Power Boost Module for your wearable projects

Desciption

The AA boost Module is DFrobot's exclusive product.One key feature is solving the 5V battery power supply problem. 
As we all know, a dry battery is 1.5V , with two or  three you still cannot reach 5V. 
Now with this AA boost module, pop in two dry batteries, flip the power switch, and you will have a 5V output to power your circuit.
Two batteries will be enough to reach standard 5V easily and convenient to use and save resources,which also provides a more simple supply scheme to Arduino sensors and controllers.
